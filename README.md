# Installation and Setup

Installation of Utopia is simple. You can find a Tl;DR of the installation and setup process just below. If you are unfamiliar with the "standard" installation process, look a bit farther down for a more comprehensive installation and setup guide.

## Basic Guide

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/DK0K322/Utopia --recursive
$ cd Ultraviolet-Node
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Replit Setup Guide
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/quiec/whatsAlfa)](https://replit.com/github/DK0K322/Utopia)
To setup on Replit, first click on the "Run on Replit" button. After loading into your repl, click on the green "Run" button. Alternatively, run the following commands:

```sh
$ npm install
$ chmod +x main.sh
$ ./main.sh
```

You will only have to run the second command once. It just allows `main.sh` to be executed. By running `main.sh`, you will update any submodules and will start the app.

**Note**: If you choose not to use `main.sh`, but would rather just run all commands manually, please note that you will have to manually install submodules by running `git update submodules --init`. Without it, `static` will not be installed, and that is a required directory.
